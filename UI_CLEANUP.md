# ✅ UI CLEANED UP!

## 🎨 What Was Changed:

### 1. **Removed Debug Panel** ✅
- ❌ Removed the red debug info box
- ✅ Clean, professional interface

### 2. **Compact Header** ✅
**Before:**
```
Duty Schedule Management
Upload and manage staff rosters with drag-and-drop Excel files
[Upload Roster Button]
```

**After:**
```
Duty Schedule    [Upload Roster Button]
```

Much cleaner and saves space!

### 3. **Removed Large Upload Zone** ✅
**Before:**
- Big drag & drop area always visible
- "Drag & Drop Your Roster Excel File"
- Large placeholder taking up space

**After:**
- No upload zone when idle
- Just the "Upload Roster" button on top
- Upload zone only appears while uploading (compact version)

### 4. **Compact Upload Display** ✅
When you click upload:
- Small inline progress bar appears
- Shows filename and progress
- Disappears when complete
- Replaced by preview results

## 📐 New Layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Duty Schedule      [Upload Roster] ←small│
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  (Only shows compact progress when      │
│   actively uploading)                   │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Preview Results / Schedule Table       │
│  (Main content area)                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
